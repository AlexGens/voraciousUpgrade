There was my log about upgrading process for electron to latest version.    
I am not fronted developer. I dont have experience in js or typescript or electron, but i want to create modern desktop application for learning language. So, here my log about knowledge which i get during upgrading application `voracious`.

* It is bad practice to use native nodejs moduler in render process, so you should choose ipcRender instead
* remote module of electron is deprecated
* alias for types it is cool feature of typesctipe. For example `type Channel = 'channel-1' | 'channel-2''`
